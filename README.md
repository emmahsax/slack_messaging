# Slack Messaging [![Main](https://github.com/emmahsax/slack_messaging/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/emmahsax/slack_messaging/actions/workflows/main.yml)

This is a simple project designed to post messages to a given Slack channel as a bot.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'slack_messaging'
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle install
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
gem install slack_messaging
```

### Usage

This project requires a config file that should look like this:

```yml
slack:
  channel: <AWESOME CHANNEL NAME>
  username: <AWESOME USER NAME>
  webhook_url: <SLACK WEBHOOK URL>
  icon_emoji: ':<SOME EMOJI>:'
```

To generate this file at `~/.slack_messaging.yml`, please run this command:

```bash
slack-messaging setup
```

To obtain the webhook URL, go to [this link](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks).

If you'd like to create the config file at a different directory, I recommend using the `setup` command, and then manually moving the file to your desired location:

```bash
slack-messaging setup
# Walk through the prompts to create the file
mv ~/.slack_messaging.yml /PATH/TO/FILE/config.yml
```

And then you can pass in that specific file location like this:

```bash
slack-messaging --config="/PATH/TO/FILE/config.yml" send
```

Once the config file is set up, the project is ready to go!

To print a friendly message to Slack, run:

```bash
slack-messaging send
```

Here, no specific message is being given to print to Slack, so slack_messaging will choose a random quote. The random quotes are selected using the [Quotable API](http://api.quotable.io/).

However, what if you wanted to print something specific? Well, you can! Just run:

```bash
slack-messaging send 'MESSAGE 1'
```

You can even print multiple messages at once:

```bash
slack-messaging send 'MESSAGE 1' 'MESSAGE 2' 'MESSAGE 3' ... 'MESSAGE N'
```

The output of slack_messaging will look something like this:

I hope you enjoy printing fun and specialized messages to Slack!

### Tests

To run the tests, run `bundle exec rspec` from the command line. GitHub Actions will also run the tests upon every commit to make sure they're up to date and that everything is working correctly. Locally, you can also run `bundle exec guard` to automatically run tests as you develop! There are currently only tests for the `notify_slack` and `random_message` classes. Feel free to help us add more!
